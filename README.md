# Obsidian Widget

Minimal Android home screen widget to add notes directly into a chosen folder of your Obsidian vault.

## Build instructions

```
./gradlew assembleDebug
```

On first run, the Gradle wrapper will download the necessary `gradle-wrapper.jar`
automatically, so this file is not kept in version control.

The resulting APK can be found under `app/build/outputs/apk/debug/`.
